# Release Notes

See [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/hardwood-hq/hardwood/releases) for downloads and more information.

## Unreleased

- `RowGroupPredicate` for split-aware row group selection. Pass `RowGroupPredicate.byteRange(start, end)` to any reader builder's `filter(...)` to restrict reading to the row groups whose midpoint falls in the given file byte range — the standard split convention used by Hadoop-style integrations (Flink `BulkFormat`, Spark file source, …). Combines with `FilterPredicate` via intersection. See [Split-Aware Reading](usage.md#split-aware-reading) and [#431](https://github.com/hardwood-hq/hardwood/issues/431).
- Coordinated `ColumnReaders.nextBatch()` and `ColumnReaders.getRecordCount()` for multi-column reads. A single call advances every underlying reader in lockstep, returns `false` when any is exhausted, and validates that the readers' record counts agree. Replaces the prior `col0.nextBatch() & col1.nextBatch() & …` idiom and gives consumers structural alignment instead of an implicit invariant. See [Reading Multiple Columns](usage.md#reading-multiple-columns), [#434](https://github.com/hardwood-hq/hardwood/issues/434), and the related contract gap [#61](https://github.com/hardwood-hq/hardwood/issues/61).

## 1.0.0.Beta2 (2026-04-29)

[Announcement blog post](https://www.morling.dev/blog/variant-support-interactive-parquet-file-tui-hardwood-1.0.0.beta2-is-out/)

Highlights of this release:

- Interactive `hardwood dive` TUI for exploring Parquet files
- Parquet Variant logical type, including shredded reassembly
- Additional logical types: INTERVAL, MAP/LIST, INT96 timestamps
- Faster reads via a parallel per-column pipeline and per-column in-page row skipping
- Reduced S3 traffic via byte-range caching, coalesced GETs, and small-column fetches
- Unified reader API based on builders
- CLI with reorganized `inspect` subcommands

See the [1.0.0.Beta2 milestone](https://github.com/hardwood-hq/hardwood/milestone/3?closed=1) on GitHub for the full list of resolved issues.
