# Release Notes

See [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/hardwood-hq/hardwood/releases) for downloads and more information.

## 1.0.0.Beta2

Highlights of this release:

- Interactive `hardwood dive` TUI for exploring Parquet files
- Parquet Variant logical type, including shredded reassembly
- Additional logical types: INTERVAL, MAP/LIST, INT96 timestamps
- Faster reads via a parallel per-column pipeline and per-column in-page row skipping
- Reduced S3 traffic via byte-range caching, coalesced GETs, and small-column fetches
- Unified reader API based on builders
- CLI is now released as a separate artifact, with reorganized `inspect` subcommands

See the [1.0.0.Beta2 milestone](https://github.com/hardwood-hq/hardwood/milestone/3?closed=1) on GitHub for the full list of resolved issues.
