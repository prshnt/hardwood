# Design: dive list-screen viewport virtualization

**Status: Implemented.** Tracking issue: #401.

## Goal

Make Up/Down navigation on every list-shaped dive screen feel instant
regardless of how large the underlying collection is. Per-keystroke work
must scale with the visible viewport, not with the total row count, so a
file with hundreds of thousands of dictionary entries, thousands of
pages, or tens of thousands of file-wide index entries navigates as
smoothly as a small file does.

## Behaviour

Each list screen's `render` constructs `Row` objects only for the rows
the table will actually paint, derived from the current selection, a
persisted `scrollTop` (the absolute row index of the first visible row),
and the available viewport height:

```
viewport = max(1, area.height() - <chrome>)   // chrome varies per screen
sel      = clamp(selection, 0, total - 1)
top      = clamp(scrollTop, 0, max(0, total - 1))
if sel < top:                top = sel                        // top-pin
elif sel >= top + viewport:  top = sel - viewport + 1         // bottom-pin
if top + viewport > total:   top = max(0, total - viewport)   // clamp tail
end = min(total, top + viewport)
```

The math lives in a shared helper, [`RowWindow.from(scrollTop,
selection, total, viewport)`](../cli/src/main/java/dev/hardwood/cli/dive/internal/RowWindow.java),
which returns the `[start, end)` range plus `selectionInWindow` (the
slice-relative selection index). Each screen builds rows for that range
only, then sets `TableState.select(window.selectionInWindow())` so the
table draws the cursor at the right row of the slice. The underlying
widget keeps its existing rendering behaviour and never sees the rest
of the collection.

Each screen's state record carries `scrollTop`, and a sibling helper
[`RowWindow.adjustTop(prevTop, selection, viewport)`](../cli/src/main/java/dev/hardwood/cli/dive/internal/RowWindow.java)
keeps it in sync on each navigation event: motion that stays inside the
existing viewport leaves `scrollTop` alone, motion that runs off the top
or bottom slides it just enough to keep `selection` visible. So a
`PgUp` from a bottom-pinned position lands the cursor at the top of the
new viewport (mirroring the data preview's per-page reload), `PgDn`
past the bottom keeps it at the bottom, and step navigation moves the
cursor within the visible rows without scrolling them.

Range header (`Plurals.rangeOf`), search bar, modal, and key bar all
still operate against the full row count.

## Affected screens

Applied to every list-shaped screen that previously built a `Row` per
collection item:

| Screen | Row source | Realistic worst N |
|---|---|---|
| `DictionaryScreen` | filtered dictionary entries | hundreds of thousands |
| `PagesScreen` | pages in a column chunk | thousands |
| `ColumnIndexScreen` | pages with stats | thousands |
| `OffsetIndexScreen` | page locations | thousands |
| `FileIndexesScreen` | row groups × columns × index types | tens of thousands |
| `ColumnChunksScreen` | columns in a row group | thousands on wide schemas |
| `ColumnAcrossRowGroupsScreen` | row groups for one column | hundreds–thousands |
| `RowGroupIndexesScreen` | columns × index types per RG | thousands on wide schemas |
| `RowGroupsScreen` | row groups | hundreds–thousands |

`DataPreviewScreen` is intentionally not on the list. It already solves
the problem one layer up: its `state.rows()` is the page-sized slice
returned from `PreviewWindow.slice(model, firstRow, pageSize, …)`,
sized to the viewport. Iterating it is already O(viewport), and the
selection is already slice-relative.

`PagesScreen` carries one extra detail: per-data-page stats (offset
index, column index, inline statistics) are addressed by a sequential
`dataPageIdx` that advances only on non-dictionary pages. After
slicing, the screen recovers `dataPageIdx` at `window.start()` by
counting non-dictionary pages in the skipped prefix — a cheap O(start)
header-type scan, not formatting work.

## Why not just keep memoising

The Dictionary screen already memoised its filter result so the *filter
predicate* did not re-run on every keystroke. That cache helped when
the filter was non-trivial, but it did not reduce the dominant
per-frame cost: building N `Row`/`Cell` objects and formatting N
values. The Table widget walks the full row list to compute its
visible window via cumulative `Row.totalHeight()`, so even off-screen
rows were constructed. Other screens did not even have a filter cache.

Slicing the rows up front fixes both at every screen: less allocation,
and the table no longer iterates the full list.

## Filter cache representation (Dictionary screen only)

The Dictionary screen still memoises its filter result, but with a
representation chosen so the empty-filter cache-hit allocates nothing.
The cache uses an `int[]` instead of `List<Integer>`, with a `null`
sentinel for the empty-filter (and "every entry matches") case
representing the identity mapping `[0, size)`. The cache key holds the
`Dictionary` via `WeakReference` so an entry evicted from the model's
bounded `dictionaryCache` is not pinned by this static slot for the
JVM lifetime.

Callers go through a small `FilterIndex` helper:

```java
private record FilterIndex(int size, int[] indices) {
    boolean isEmpty() { return size == 0; }
    int at(int i) { return indices == null ? i : indices[i]; }
}
```

This optimisation is Dictionary-specific and does not transfer — the
other list screens have no `/`-style filter.

## Convention

`CLAUDE.md` carries the rule in its Dive TUI section: list-shaped
screens must build `Row` objects only for the visible viewport, using
`RowWindow.bottomPinned(...)`. New list screens inherit this from the
start.
