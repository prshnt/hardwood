/// A `RowMatcher` is built once per [dev.hardwood.reader.RowReader] by
/// [RecordFilterCompiler] and reused for every row. By holding all
/// invariant state (column indices, leaf names, struct paths, literal
/// operands, child arrays) in fields rather than recomputing per row, the
/// compiler eliminates the type and operator switches that
/// [RecordFilterEvaluator] performs.
///
/// Each leaf type (one for every combination of value type and operator)
/// is its own concrete class — or factory-produced lambda — so that JIT
/// call sites see a single receiver type and can inline aggressively.
